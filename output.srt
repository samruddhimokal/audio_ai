1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:03,773
Speaker 1: Mary?

2
00:00:03,793 --> 00:00:03,833
Speaker 0: Hi.

3
00:00:05,514 --> 00:00:06,714
Speaker 0: Hello.

4
00:00:06,914 --> 00:00:08,835
Speaker 1: I'm Susan Thompson, resource manager.

5
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:09,615
Speaker 0: Hi.

6
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,796
Speaker 0: I'm Mary Hansen, and I'm applying for one of your kitchen jobs.

7
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:13,596
Speaker 0: Great.

8
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:15,237
Speaker 0: Here's a copy of my resume.

9
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:16,257
Speaker 0: Great.

10
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,037
Speaker 0: Have a seat, Mary.

11
00:00:17,077 --> 00:00:17,717
Speaker 0: Thank you.

12
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,680
Speaker 1: Mary, do you have any experience working in the kitchen?

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,060
Speaker 0: No, but I want to learn.

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,321
Speaker 0: I work hard, and I cook a lot at home.

15
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:31,962
Speaker 1: OK.

16
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:33,142
Speaker 0: Well, tell me about yourself.

17
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:37,442
Speaker 0: Well, I love to learn new things.

18
00:00:38,022 --> 00:00:39,623
Speaker 0: I'm very organized.

19
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:43,224
Speaker 0: And I follow directions exactly.

20
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,346
Speaker 0: That's why my boss at my last job made me a trainer.

21
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:55,308
Speaker 0: And the company actually gave me a special certificate for coming to work on time every day for a year.

22
00:00:56,528 --> 00:01:01,650
Speaker 0: And I'm taking an English class to improve my writing skills.

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:03,120
Speaker 1: That's great.

24
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,181
Speaker 0: Why did you leave your last job?

25
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,443
Speaker 0: It was graveyard, and I need to work days.

26
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:09,804
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.

27
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:11,565
Speaker 0: Well, what hours can you work?

28
00:01:12,346 --> 00:01:13,767
Speaker 0: From 8 AM until 5 PM.

29
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,048
Speaker 0: OK.

30
00:01:15,068 --> 00:01:16,749
Speaker 0: Well, do you have any questions for me, Mary?

31
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:17,970
Speaker 0: Yes.

32
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,391
Speaker 0: What kind of training is needed?

33
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,173
Speaker 1: Not a lot.

34
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:24,814
Speaker 1: Most new workers can learn everything the first day.

35
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,636
Speaker 0: Do you have any other questions?

36
00:01:27,376 --> 00:01:29,098
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so.

37
00:01:29,418 --> 00:01:32,901
Speaker 0: But I've heard a lot of good things about your company, and I would really like to work here.

38
00:01:33,501 --> 00:01:35,463
Speaker 0: Well, I have a few more interviews to do today.

39
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:35,523
Speaker 1: OK.

40
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:38,065
Speaker 1: But I will call you tomorrow if you get the job.

41
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:38,665
Speaker 0: OK.

42
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:39,826
Speaker 1: It was sure nice to meet you.

43
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:40,787
Speaker 0: Nice meeting you too.

44
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:42,068
Speaker 0: Thank you so much for your time.

45
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:42,848
Speaker 0: Yes, good luck.

46
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:43,269
Speaker 0: Thank you.
